  "Use when an owner wants small checks that warn when work drifts - a branch
  that grows too big, work that stalls, or a security note that goes stale - and
  wants to set how often they run and who hears about them. First-time setup, a
  repository with no drift checks, or a team changing the thresholds. Installs
  the check scripts and writes .thrum/policy/checks.json. Runs as one part of
  project-onboarding and on its own."

## onboarding-checks

Sets up the drift checks. It asks for the branch prefixes to watch, the size and
stalled thresholds, how often the checks run and how a report is delivered,
copies the check scripts into `.thrum/policy/checks/`, and writes
`.thrum/policy/checks.json`. `resources/checks-schema.md` defines every key. The
`answers.cadence` and `sections.S5` records go in
`.thrum/policy/onboarding.json`. The section is the same on the Free and the Pro
setup, because monitors, checks and delivery are not licensed.

### Opening offer

Show this offer before any other question.

<!-- onboarding:offer -->

> Say: This part sets up small checks that warn you when work drifts: a branch
> that grows too big, work that stalls, or a security note that goes stale. It
> asks how often each one should run; the coordinator part schedules them. Ask:
> Do this part now, or skip it for now? If you skip it, running
> project-onboarding again offers it again.

<!-- /onboarding:offer -->

"Skip it for now" records `sections.S5.status: skipped` with `reason: owner` in
`.thrum/policy/onboarding.json` and ends the section. "Do it now" goes on. When
this skill runs alone the same offer is shown, and a skip never changes a record
that is already `done`.

When `.thrum/policy/onboarding.json` is absent, this skill creates
`.thrum/policy/` and the file, and leaves `profile` unset so it reads as `team`.
It never reads the licence.

### History analysis

When .thrum/results/history-analysis.md is absent or stale, follow
history-analysis.md in the project-onboarding resources before the first block.

### Plain terms

Before each question that uses one of these terms, show its one-line explanation
first, as a `> Say:` line starting "In plain terms:". The terms are cadence,
wake-on-change, delivery and monitor:

> Say: In plain terms: the cadence is how often a check runs, for example every
> 24 hours. Say: In plain terms: wake-on-change means a check speaks up only
> when something new has happened since its last report, and stays quiet
> otherwise. Say: In plain terms: delivery is how a report reaches the agent
> that should read it: into its terminal window when it has one open, or into
> its inbox. Say: In plain terms: a monitor is a small timer that runs a check
> again and again, so nobody has to remember to.

### The settings

These are the values this skill offers and writes. They are never values a
script falls back to: a check script that finds no `checks.json`, or no key in
it, reports the miss and stops.

| Setting                                 | Key in `checks.json` | Offered value                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| branch prefixes the scope check watches | `branch_globs`       | fix/ feature/ feat/ refactor/ test/ (`["fix/", "feature/", "feat/", "refactor/", "test/"]`) |
| a branch is large                       | `size_threshold`     | more than 300 lines (`lines: 300`) or more than 15 files (`files: 15`)                      |
| a branch is stalled                     | `stalled_hours`      | stalled after 6 h (`6`)                                                                     |
| how often the checks run                | `cadence_hours`      | the hours that `resources/suggest-cadence.sh` prints                                        |
| how a report is delivered               | `delivery`           | `auto`                                                                                      |

The other keys of `resources/checks-schema.md` are written from the schema as it
defines them: `test_globs`, `merge_target_from` and `security_doc` with their
schema values, and `deliver_to` and `dashboard_generator` left out.
`coordinator` is written later by `onboarding-coordinator`, never here.

#### Cadence

Run `resources/suggest-cadence.sh` from the repository root. It prints the
suggested hours on stdout and its basis on stderr, and it is suggested again on
every re-run, because how often work lands changes. It needs no `checks.json`.
When it exits 1 it prints no hours: show its reason to the owner and ask for the
hours themselves, never assume one.

#### Delivery

The offered value is `auto`, which the owner can override (`pane` or `inbox`).
To show what `auto` does today, run `thrum tmux status --json` and report
whether the agent that will receive reports has a live tmux session: with one
the report goes to its terminal window (the pane), without one to its inbox.
`checks.json` records `auto`, not the resolved value. The recipient is the merge
king of the merge target, `orchestration.merge_kings[<merge target>]`; the
schema says how that resolves when `deliver_to` is absent.

### Solo

Read `profile` in `.thrum/policy/onboarding.json`. Under `profile: solo`, show
every setting in one table: the branch prefixes, the size thresholds, the
stalled time, the suggested cadence and the detected delivery, each with its "In
plain terms:" line where it uses a term above. With little history, the cadence
rule already gives 24 h.

Each row has a plain label, its value and its reason. Never show a raw key as a
row's name.

A Solo row uses the same keys.

Then ask once:

> Ask: These are the recommended check settings for a solo setup. Use them as
> they are, or review each one?

- On "use them", write the values as shown and ask nothing more.
- On "review", ask each setting as for a team.

### Team

Ask the settings in the table above as one block, following
`resources/question-blocks.md` of project-onboarding. Each row has a plain
label, never the raw key, and its offered value is the Recommended answer: the
prefixes, the two size thresholds, the stalled time, the cadence (Why: the
suggestion and its basis) and the delivery (Why: what `auto` does today). The
owner keeps or changes each row.

Record how each answer was given in answers_source, and a note the owner added
in answers_notes, under these keys, in row order: checks_branch_globs,
checks_size_threshold, checks_stalled_hours, checks_cadence_hours,
checks_delivery. The two size thresholds are one row.

When the history read was skipped or found nothing, put the History: line under
every fallback line, as question-blocks.md says.

### Install

1. Create `.thrum/policy/checks/` and copy `lib.sh` and the three scripts
   `scope-check.sh`, `security-check.sh` and `suggest-cadence.sh` from this
   skill's `resources/` into it, keeping the file modes. Every check script
   sources `lib.sh` from its own folder.
2. Write `.thrum/policy/checks.json` with the keys of
   `resources/checks-schema.md` and the owner's values. On a re-run, read the
   existing file first and show each value that differs from the one offered;
   write the whole file back in one pass.
3. Write `answers.cadence` (the hours) in `onboarding.json`.

### No monitors here

This skill installs no monitor and schedules nothing. Tell the owner that
onboarding-coordinator installs the monitors, at `answers.cadence`, and offer to
run it now. If the owner says yes, hand over to `onboarding-coordinator`; if
not, say that running project-onboarding or `onboarding-coordinator` later will
do it.

### The reports

The scope check counts added lines in production files, leaving out test files
and Markdown, and reads branches from this machine and from origin. The security
check reports hits that have landed and hits on branches that have not, and
labels each.

### The security check

This skill reads no security-model file and raises no notice about one. It
states the rule, and the skill that decides it is `onboarding-coordinator`.

The security-check monitor, which `onboarding-coordinator` decides, is installed
only when the S1 watch-list block records `non_goals_confirmed: true`.

When it is `false`, the security check is not scheduled, and the owner is told
why once. A re-run after S1 confirms a non-goal installs it.

### Finish

- Write `sections.S5` (`status`, `date`, `sha`) and `answers.cadence` in
  `onboarding.json`.
- Write nothing outside `.thrum/policy/`.
